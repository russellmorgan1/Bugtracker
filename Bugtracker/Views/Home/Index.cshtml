</div><!--This is quite peculiar. I may have to inquire to an expert. It's weird that it's throwing back
          that error about the sequence containing more than one element. It seems like it wouldn't be 
          trying to pull from your database with an AddOrUpdate method....though I don't really kinow
          what methods are being invoked when we call update-database to entity framework. That could be
          some method that its calling through the process of updating the database....let me see if
          the stack trace says anything about it...-->
